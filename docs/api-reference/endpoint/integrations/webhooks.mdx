Create webhook integrations to receive real-time notifications about security events, access activities, and system status changes. Webhooks enable your applications to respond immediately to important events.

## Webhook Event Types

### Security Events
- **Access Granted/Denied**: Door access attempts
- **Motion Detection**: Camera motion alerts
- **Policy Violations**: Security policy breaches
- **Intrusion Detection**: Unauthorized access attempts

### System Events
- **Device Online/Offline**: Camera and controller status
- **Health Alerts**: System health warnings
- **Configuration Changes**: System setting modifications
- **User Management**: User account changes

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
Webhook endpoints should be secured with HTTPS and proper authentication. Validate webhook signatures to prevent spoofing attacks.
</Warning>

### Best Practices
- Use HTTPS endpoints only
- Implement webhook signature verification
- Set up proper rate limiting on your endpoint
- Log webhook deliveries for debugging
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate events

<Note>
Webhooks include retry logic with exponential backoff. If your endpoint is consistently unavailable, the webhook may be automatically disabled to prevent system impact.
