Create a new access control group to organize users with similar access permissions. Groups simplify permission management by allowing you to grant or revoke access to multiple users simultaneously.

## Use Cases

- **Department-based Access**: Create groups for different departments (Engineering, HR, Sales)
- **Role-based Access**: Organize users by their roles (Managers, Employees, Contractors)
- **Temporary Access**: Create groups for visitors or temporary workers
- **Location-based Access**: Group users who need access to specific areas

## Key Features

- Hierarchical group structure support
- Bulk user management capabilities
- Integration with location access grants
- Audit trail for group modifications

<Note>
Access control groups are the foundation of the Rhombus permission system. Plan your group structure carefully to ensure scalable access management.
