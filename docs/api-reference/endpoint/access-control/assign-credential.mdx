Assign an unassigned access control credential (badge, key card, or mobile credential) to a specific user. This endpoint enables you to activate physical access credentials for users.

## Credential Types Supported

- **Badge Cards**: RFID/NFC badge cards
- **Key Fobs**: RFID key fobs
- **Mobile Credentials**: Smartphone-based access
- **Biometric Credentials**: Fingerprint or face recognition data
- **Wiegand Formats**: Standard industry formats (H10301, D10202, etc.)

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
Ensure credentials are assigned only to authorized users. Once assigned, credentials provide physical access according to the user's group permissions.
</Warning>

## Integration Notes

- Credentials must be created before they can be assigned
- Assignment triggers access control system synchronization
- Supports both Rhombus and third-party credential formats
