---

Create automated security policies that monitor for specific conditions and trigger appropriate responses. Policies enable proactive security management and automated incident response.

## Policy Types

### Motion Detection Policies
- **Area Monitoring**: Detect motion in restricted areas
- **After Hours Detection**: Monitor for activity outside business hours
- **Perimeter Security**: Detect intrusion attempts
- **Crowd Detection**: Monitor for unusual gatherings

### Access Control Policies
- **Failed Access Attempts**: Monitor for repeated access failures
- **Tailgating Detection**: Detect multiple people using single credential
- **Unusual Access Patterns**: Identify suspicious access behavior
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Enforce access hour limitations

### System Health Policies
- **Device Offline Monitoring**: Alert when cameras/controllers go offline
- **Storage Monitoring**: Monitor storage capacity and health
- **Network Issues**: Detect connectivity problems
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor system performance metrics

<Warning>
Test policies thoroughly before enabling in production. Incorrectly configured policies can generate excessive alerts or miss important events.

## Policy Management Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Define Clear Objectives">
Clearly define what each policy should accomplish and what constitutes a valid alert.
</Step>

<Step title="Start with Conservative Settings">
Begin with higher thresholds and adjust based on actual performance to minimize false positives.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Thoroughly">
Test policies in a controlled environment before deploying to production systems.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor and Adjust">
Regularly review policy performance and adjust thresholds based on operational feedback.
</Step>
