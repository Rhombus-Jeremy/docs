Generate detailed access control reports for compliance auditing, security analysis, and operational insights. Reports can be customized for different time periods, locations, and user groups.

## Report Types

- **Failed Access Attempts**: Security incidents and potential threats
- **User Access Summary**: Access patterns by user
- **Location Access Summary**: Access patterns by location
- **Credential Usage**: Badge and credential utilization

### Security Analysis Reports
- **Unusual Access Patterns**: Anomalous behavior detection
- **After Hours Access**: Access outside normal business hours
- **Multiple Location Access**: Users accessing multiple locations rapidly
- **Shared Credential Detection**: Possible credential sharing

### Operational Reports
- **Peak Usage Times**: Busiest access periods
- **Location Utilization**: Most and least used entrances
- **System Performance**: Reader response times and reliability
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Components requiring attention

- **Audit Trail**: All report generation is logged for compliance tracking
