## Performance Monitoring

The API returns performance metrics for each component:

- **Network Statistics**: Bandwidth usage, packet loss, latency
- **Storage Usage**: Local storage utilization for edge recording
- **Power Consumption**: PoE power draw and efficiency
- **Temperature**: Operating temperature for thermal management
- **Error Rates**: Communication errors and retry statistics
