## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api2.rhombussystems.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```json
{
  "x-auth-apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. API keys provide full access to your Rhombus organization.
</Warning>

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Rhombus Console">
  Log in to your [Rhombus Console](https://console.rhombussystems.com) with your organization credentials.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to API Settings">
  Go to **Settings** â†’ **API Keys** in the console navigation.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate New API Key">

</Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure system stability. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

<Tip>
Implement exponential backoff in your applications to handle rate limiting gracefully.
</Tip>

## Automatic Updates

This API documentation is automatically updated nightly from the latest Rhombus API specification. The OpenAPI spec is fetched from our production API to ensure accuracy.
