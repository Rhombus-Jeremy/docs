# Welcome to Rhombus

<Info>
**API-First Architecture**

Founded in 2016, Rhombus was built on a foundation of **API-driven micro-services**. Everything our system can do can also be done via the Rhombus API - the same endpoints power our mobile apps, web console, and even firmware.
</Info>

Welcome to the comprehensive developer documentation for Rhombus. Here you'll discover how to integrate with our security platform and build powerful applications using our robust API ecosystem.
