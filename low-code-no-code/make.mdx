  **Visual Automation Platform**

  Make.com (formerly Integromat) is a powerful visual automation platform that lets you design complex workflows. Connect Rhombus with thousands of apps using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
</Info>

Automate your security operations by connecting Rhombus with thousands of apps through Make.com. Build sophisticated workflows visually with triggers, actions, and conditional logic.

## What is Make.com?

Make.com is an advanced automation platform that lets you create "scenarios" - visual workflows that connect apps and automate processes. With Make.com, you can design complex multi-step automations with conditional logic, data transformations, and error handling.
