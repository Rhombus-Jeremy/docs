Rhombus exposes every platform capability through a single OpenAPI-driven surface area. This guide helps you understand how the Mintlify-powered reference is organized and how to get the most out of it.

<Tip>
  Looking for a specific endpoint? Use the lefthand navigation search or jump directly with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>.
</Tip>

## How the reference is built

- **Single source of truth** - The `api-reference/openapi.json` file is synced every night from production, so you always browse the latest contract.
- **Automatic navigation** - Each navigation entry points straight to the OpenAPI operation (`method + path`), ensuring you never land on stale handcrafted docs.
- **Split specs for tooling** - Category-specific specs live in `api-reference/openapi-split/`. Load only what you need when working with large language models or generators.

<Note>
  If you update the platform, run `./scripts/update-openapi.sh` followed by `./scripts/split-openapi.sh` to refresh both the main spec and category slices.
</Note>

## Explore the API efficiently

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with API Essentials">
    Review the **Authentication** and **Errors & Rate Limits** pages in this section so you know how to authorize requests and interpret common responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate the right service">
    Services are grouped under areas like Core Services, Devices, Analytics, and more. Open a group to reveal CRUD-style subgroups (Create, Get, Update, Delete, Other).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect schemas and examples">
    Each OpenAPI entry includes request bodies, parameters, and schema references. Expand individual schema nodes to view property descriptions without leaving the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prototype quickly">
    Copy the `Try it` snippet or download the OpenAPI spec to generate a typed client with your preferred language.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Request workflow example

<RequestExample
  method="POST"
  url="https://api2.rhombussystems.com/api/camera/getDetails"
  label="Fetch camera details"
  auth="API Key"
  :headers="[
    { key: 'Content-Type', value: 'application/json' },
    { key: 'x-auth-scheme', value: 'api-token' },
    { key: 'x-auth-apikey', value: 'rhombus_demo_4c1f2f1f8a274a32' }
  ]"
  :body="{
    cameraUuid: 'c9b31b8e-56bd-42f2-9eb2-8a12cc4c6d15'
  }"
/>

<ResponseExample
  :response="{
    camera: {
      uuid: 'c9b31b8e-56bd-42f2-9eb2-8a12cc4c6d15',
      name: 'Warehouse Loading Dock',
      status: 'ONLINE',
      timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles'
    }
  }"
  status="200"
  label="Successful response"
/>

## Tools that speed up integration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mintlify UI">
    Browse endpoints, read schema descriptions, and try requests without leaving the documentation site.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenAPI Generator">
    ```bash
    openapi-generator-cli generate \
      -i https://api2.rhombussystems.com/api/openapi/public.json \
      -g typescript-axios \
      -o ./clients/typescript
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LLM Context">
    Use the split specifications in `api-reference/openapi-split/` when you need a smaller context window for AI tooling.
