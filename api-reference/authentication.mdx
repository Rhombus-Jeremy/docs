title: "Authentication"
description: "Authenticate every request to the Rhombus API with organization-level API keys and consistent header formats."
icon: "key"
---

All Rhombus API calls require an authenticated user or integration key. The platform currently supports API key authentication by passing two headers on every request.

<Warning>
  Treat API keys like admin passwords. Store them in a secure secrets manager and rotate them on a schedule.
</Warning>

## Required headers

Include both headers with every request, even when the body is empty:

```http
x-auth-scheme: api-token
x-auth-apikey: rhombus_demo_4c1f2f1f8a274a32
```

- `x-auth-scheme` identifies the authentication strategy. `api-token` covers the standard API key workflow used by most integrations.
- `x-auth-apikey` carries your organization-specific key generated in the Rhombus Console.

<Note>
  Certificate-backed authentication is available for advanced customers. Contact Rhombus Support to enable and receive signing instructions.
</Note>

## Generate and rotate keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a key">
    Visit **Console > Settings > API Management** and create a new token. Give it a descriptive name that maps to your integration or environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scope access">
    Choose the minimal permission set required. Restricting scope limits the impact of accidental leakage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribute securely">
    Store keys in a vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.). Inject them at runtime through environment variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rotate regularly">
    Schedule rotations, update your deployments, and revoke old keys to maintain trust.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common authentication errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
    Returned when headers are missing or incorrect. Verify both `x-auth-scheme` and `x-auth-apikey` are present and valid.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
    The key is valid but lacks required permissions. Create a new key with the appropriate scope or request elevated access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
    You hit a rate limit. See **Errors & Rate Limits** for retry guidance.
