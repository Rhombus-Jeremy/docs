Returns the estimated occupancy count for a specified room or area within a given time range. This endpoint allows you to monitor occupancy trends over time or retrieve a single count for a defined interval.
Important: An occupancy region must be defined in the Rhombus Console before using this endpoint.
You can optionally specify an interval (e.g., MINUTELY, QUARTERHOURLY, HOURLY ...) to retrieve occupancy counts broken down by sub-intervals between startTime and endTime.
If no interval is provided, a single occupancy count is returned for the entire duration between startTime and endTime.
