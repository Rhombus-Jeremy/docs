## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Get Your API Key">
  Generate an API key from your [Rhombus Console](https://console.rhombussystems.com) under **Settings** â†’ **API Keys**.
  
  <Warning>
  Store your API key securely - it provides full access to your organization's data.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Make Your First Request">
  Test your connection with a simple API call:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X GET "https://api2.rhombussystems.com/api/org" \
    -H "x-auth-apikey: YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
  
  ```python Python
  import requests
  
  headers = {"x-auth-apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
  response = requests.get("https://api2.rhombussystems.com/api/org", headers=headers)
  print(response.json())
  ```
  
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const response = await fetch('https://api2.rhombussystems.com/api/org', {
    headers: {
      'x-auth-apikey': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Explore with Postman">
  Import our [Postman collection](https://docs.rhombus.com) to explore all available endpoints with pre-configured examples and documentation.
</Step>

<Step title="Join the Community">
  Connect with other developers at [rhombus.community](https://rhombus.community) to share knowledge, get help, and showcase your integrations.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Base URL & Authentication

All API requests are made to our base URL:

```
https://api2.rhombussystems.com
```

Include your API key in every request header:

```json
{
  "x-auth-apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

## Rate Limits & Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rate Limits">
    API requests are rate limited to ensure system stability:
    - **Standard**: 1000 requests per hour
    - **Burst**: 100 requests per minute
    
    Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
    ```
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
    X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    - **Implement exponential backoff** for 429 responses
    - **Cache responses** when possible to reduce API calls
    - **Use webhooks** for real-time events instead of polling
    - **Batch requests** when the API supports it
    - **Monitor your usage** through the console dashboard
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Error Handling">
    All errors return standard HTTP status codes with detailed JSON responses:
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_API_KEY",
        "message": "The provided API key is invalid or expired",
        "details": "Check your API key in the Rhombus Console"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
