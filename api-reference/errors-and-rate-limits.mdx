Rhombus responses follow standard HTTP semantics: a `2xx` status means success, while `4xx` and `5xx` codes indicate client or server issues. Error bodies are structured JSON objects that help you diagnose what went wrong.

## Error payload shape

<ResponseExample
  status="400"
  label="Validation error"
  :response="{
    errorCode: 'INVALID_ARGUMENT',
    message: 'cameraUuid must be a valid UUID',
    details: [
      { field: 'cameraUuid', description: 'Expected UUID v4' }
    ]
  }"
/>

- `errorCode` - Machine-readable identifier that stays consistent across releases.
- `message` - Human-friendly context you can log or surface to support teams.
- `details` - Optional array that pinpoints invalid fields or missing parameters.

## Common status codes

- **400 Bad Request** - Input failed validation or required fields are missing.
- **401 Unauthorized** - Authentication headers are absent or invalid.
- **403 Forbidden** - The key lacks permission for the requested resource.
- **404 Not Found** - The resource does not exist or you provided an unknown identifier.
- **409 Conflict** - The operation conflicts with current state (for example, duplicate creation).
- **429 Too Many Requests** - You exceeded the allowed request rate.
- **5xx Server Errors** - Temporary issues on the Rhombus platform. Retries are usually successful.

## Rate limiting

Rhombus applies per-organization and per-endpoint rate limits. When you exceed the threshold, the API returns `429` along with retry guidance.

<ResponseExample
  status="429"
  label="Rate limited"
  :response="{
    errorCode: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED',
    message: 'Too many requests. Please retry after the interval in Retry-After header.'
  }"
/>

<Tip>
  Inspect the `Retry-After` header to determine when you can safely retry. The value is expressed in seconds.
</Tip>

## Build resilient clients

- Log both the HTTP status code and `errorCode` so you can diagnose issues quickly.
- Implement exponential backoff (for example, 1s, 2s, 4s) for `429` and `5xx` responses.
- Short-circuit retries for `4xx` errors that indicate permanent failures.
- Alert your team when error rates spike to catch credential or configuration regressions.

## Testing failure scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simulate 401">
    Remove the `x-auth-apikey` header or provide an intentionally revoked key to confirm your error handling path.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Simulate 400">
    Send malformed bodies (for example, omit required fields) and assert that your validation catches the error before reaching production.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Simulate 429">
    Use a load-testing tool to trigger the rate limiter in a sandbox environment. Verify your backoff logic and monitoring alerts fire correctly.
